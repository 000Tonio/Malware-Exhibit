Dubbed TangleBot, the malware first appeared in September and once installed gains access to many different permissions required for eavesdropping on communications and stealing sensitive data, including the ability to monitor all user activity, use the camera, listen to audio, monitor the location of the device, and more. Currently, it's targeting users in the US and Canada.
