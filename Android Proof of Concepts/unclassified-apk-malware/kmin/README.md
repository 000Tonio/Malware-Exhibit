# Trojan:Android/Kmin
Affects mobile devices running the Android OS operating system and attempts to send Android device data to a remote server for collection by an attacker. The trojan may pose as an Android app named "KMHome".

Upon execution, variants in the Kmin trojan family display a message asking the user for a permission to proceed with a specified action; the A variant asks whether the user wishes to install a paid app and subscribe to a service, while the B and C variants only enquire whether the user would like to install a paid application.

Regardless of whether the user accepts or declines, the app will proceed with the following actions:

    Sending the Internation Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number and phone number to a remote server
    Sending SMS messages to a premium-rate number
    Downloading and installing another application
    Running services in the background
