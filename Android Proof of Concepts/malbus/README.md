# Malbus
threat actors behind the MalBus campaign targeted legitimate developers of apps that already had a solid and deserved reputation. By compromising the developer accounts, the threat actors were able to add an additional library before uploading the updated app to Google Play. That library ran an update process during the app installation that downloaded and then dynamically loaded a malicious Trojan disguised as a media file with a .mov extension.
