# mobile-crypto-ransomware-simplocker-now-on-steroids
    Simplocker is a mobile trojan, one of the first of its kind, that targets Android mobile devices. 
    This malware scans the resident SD card for certain file types 
    (.jpeg, .jpg, .png, .bmp, .gif, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .avi, .mkv, .3gp, .mp4), 
    encrypts these files using AES, and then demands a ransom from the user in exchange for the decryption of these ransomed files. 
    The result is that, until this ransom is paid, users are unable to access their personal files (pictures, downloads, songs, etc.)
