## VirTool.

VirTool programs can be used to modify other malicious programs so that they cannot be detected by antivirus software.

VirTool. is Malwarebytesâ€™ detection name for a category of riskware that is used to create malware and make them more difficult to detect, such as obfuscating its code.

## Type and source of infection

Riskware, in general, is a detection for items that are not strictly malicious but pose some sort of risk for the user in another way. In some countries, having an item detected as VirTool. on your computer could get you into legal problems.

VirTool detections are typically downloaded from less reputable sites, and the files may be backdoored. Users may also get malware instead of the promised encryption tool.
