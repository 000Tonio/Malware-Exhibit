# Generic Trojans
    Trojan horse malware is a file, program, or piece of code that appears to be legitimate and safe, but is actually malware. 
    Trojans are packaged and delivered inside legitimate software (thus their name), 
    and they're often designed to spy on victims or steal data (Nov, 2021)
