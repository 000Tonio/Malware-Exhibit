## Novelty Malware ğŸ¤­ :

       ğŸ‘‰ FreeBSD malware
       ğŸ‘‰ SunOS malware
       ğŸ‘‰ Symbian OS malware
       ğŸ‘‰ Discord-specific malware

These as well:

    ğŸ‘‰ Randomly collected in the wild,
    ğŸ‘‰ Shared by victims or other malware researchers
    ğŸ‘‰ Some seem incomplete (C2 servers missing)
    ğŸ‘‰ Have not been reversed engineered by me or anyone whatsoever to the best of my knowledge
    ğŸ‘‰ A lot of SMB it seems though
    
    Careful yo!ğŸ˜‹
