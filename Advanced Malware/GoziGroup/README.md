# Gozi Malware Family
Also known as RM3, ISFB, Ursnif, Dreambot, CRM, and Snifula, Gozi can be considered as a group of malware families which are based on the same malicious codebase. Historically, it has been known as one of the most widely spread and longest-standing Banking Trojans with more than 14 years of activity. Its unique modular architecture facilitates multiple Threat Actors (TAs) in carrying on with their own malicious purposes, which in most cases are included in the following categories:

    Banking fraud
    eCommerce fraud
    POS devices compromise
    Ransomware 

Since its source-code was leaked in 2015, tracking all the different variants appears to be knotty and time consuming due to its fragmentation and the several distinct names used by security firms and researchers.
