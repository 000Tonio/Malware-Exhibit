## Bbauk 
Babuk, also known internally as Babyk, initially “Vasa Locker,” is a pretty new ransomware threat discovered at the beginning of 2021. The gang, defining itself as a non-malicious group created to reveal the security issues inside the corporate networks, is responsible for attacks on at least five big enterprises. 

According to security researchers, Babuk Locker’s coding is amateurish but includes secure encryption that prevents victims from recovering their files for free.

In April 2021, the group threatened Washington D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department (M.P.D.) to release sensitive information pulled from the department’s systems and demanded a $4 million ransom. Babuk’s cybercriminals declared they had downloaded 250 GigaBytes of data and threatened to release information about police informants to criminal gangs and to continue attacking the state sectors, including the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
