## Carbanak
Carbanak is an APT-style campaign targeting (but not limited to) financial institutions, that was discovered in 2014 by the Russian cyber security company Kaspersky Lab. It utilizes malware that is introduced into systems running Microsoft Windows using phishing emails, which is then used to steal money from banks via macros in documents. The hacker group is said to have stolen over 900 million dollars, from the banks as well as from over a thousand private customers.

The criminals were able to manipulate their access to the respective banking networks in order to steal the money in a variety of ways. In some instances, ATMs were instructed to dispense cash without having to locally interact with the terminal. Money mules would collect the money and transfer it over the SWIFT network to the criminalsâ€™ accounts, Kaspersky said. The Carbanak group went so far as to alter databases and pump up balances on existing accounts and pocketing the difference unbeknownst to the user whose original balance is still intact.

Their intended targets were primarily in Russia, followed by the United States, Germany, China and Ukraine, according to Kaspersky Lab. One bank lost $7.3 million when its ATMs were programmed to spew cash at certain times that henchmen would then collect, while a separate firm had $10 million taken via its online platform.

## How does carbanak work

attackers enter the system through spear phishing. After gaining a foothold in the system, the dynamic data exchange (DDE) feature in Windows and legitimate cloud-based services will then be abused to deliver the malware or to establish command-and-control (C&C) communication.

After this, the Carbanak backdoor can then be used to log keystrokes and capture screenshots, steal and delete cookies, inject malicious code on sites, and monitor various traffic. For lateral movement, the malware abuses remote and system administration tools.
