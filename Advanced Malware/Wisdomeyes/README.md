## Infection

The worm copies itself multiple times to a hard drive and also affects HTML files.

The worm's file is polymorphically encrypted, which means every copy of the worm is different. The only constant aspect of the worm's code is the size of its executable file - 57856 bytes.

The worm creates a different CLSID for every copy of itself that it creates on the hard drive. The number of these copies can be quite large. The names of the worm's files are random. For example:

    bzehxvnz.exe
    hwexrtne.exe
    jbnshhqj.exe
    jjlenkbt.exe
    tsbjbtvn.exe
