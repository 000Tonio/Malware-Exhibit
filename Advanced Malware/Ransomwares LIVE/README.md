## Fox Ransomware
Discovered by MalwareHunterTeam, FOX is a new variant of high-risk ransomware called Matrix. Developers proliferate this malware using Remote Desktop Service - they hijack victims' computers and install FOX manually.
Once infiltrated, FOX encrypts most stored data and renames files using the "[developer's_email].[random_characters].FOX" pattern (e.g., "sample.jpg" might be renamed to a filename such as "[PabFox@protonmail.com ].3qAbTbsd-RgfExin0.FOX"). Once encrypted, data becomes unusable and indistinguishable.
In addition, FOX performs a number of other malicious actions, including deletion of File Shadow Volume Copies and removal of Windows Recovery Startup. After performing these functions, FOX generates a text file ("#FOX_README#.rtf") and places a copy in every existing folder. Additionally, FOX ransomware changes victim's desktop wallpaper.

## Katyusha Ransomware
Katyusha is ransomware discovered by Michael Gillespie. After successful infiltration, this virus encrypts most stored files (thereby making them unusable) and adds the ".katyusha" appendix to each filename. For instance, "sample.jpg" is renamed to "sample.jpg.katyusha". As well as encrypting data, Katyusha generates a text file called "_how_to_decrypt_you_files.txt" and places it on the desktop.
The new text file contains a message stating that data is encrypted and that victims must pay a ransom to restore it. No technical information regarding encryption is provided and, thus, it is not known whether Katyusha uses symmetric or asymmetric cryptography. In any case, decryption requires a unique key generated individually for each victim.

Cyber criminals hide all keys on a remote server and victims are encouraged to pay for their release. The cost is .5 Bitcoin (currently equivalent to ~$3200). It is also stated that victims have just three days to make up their mind. After this period, decryption keys are permanently deleted, thereby making it impossible to restore files.

As compared to other ransomware-type viruses, the cost of Katyusha decryption is high, since most demand $500-1500.

## Kryptik Ransomware
Kryptik (also known as Win32/Kryptik.BGIS) is a backdoor trojan, which is often installed without users' knowledge. Therefore, people do not install programs of this type intentionally. When installed, Kryptik can be controlled remotely.

Using this feature, cyber criminals attempt to trick people into installing Kryptik so that they can steal information and then use it to generate revenue. If there is any reason to believe that Kryptik is installed on the operating system, remove it immediately.
Furthermore, the term "Kryptik" (also known as Krypt, Cryptic, Crypt, and Packed) is used by various malware databases to describe "packed" (compressed) files.
