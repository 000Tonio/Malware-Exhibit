Few things:
1. Dont deploy on your personal machine. These stuff can go on to infect other device in your network.
2. If there is a password on the ZIP....the password is 'infected'.....without the quotes.

```
The malware in this repo is either:
  1. Built by me
  2. Analysed by me
  3. Acquired and retrieved during threat hunting and threat intelligence

```
