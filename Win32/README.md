# Win32
The Windows API, informally WinAPI, is Microsoft's core set of application programming interfaces available in the Microsoft Windows operating systems. 
The name Windows API collectively refers to several different platform implementations that are often referred to by their own names.
It allows user-written programs to interact with Windows, for example to display things on screen and get input from mouse and keyboard. All Windows programs except console programs must interact with the Windows API regardless of the language.
