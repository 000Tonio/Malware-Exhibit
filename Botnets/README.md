## Kaiten Botnet

new and improved version of Kaiten, an Internet Relay Chat (IRC)-controlled malware typically used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The remastered malware has been dubbed “KTN-Remastered” or “KTN-RM”, with three versions of Linux/Remaiten already identified by ESET researchers. Based on artifacts in the code, the main feature of the malware is an improved spreading mechanism.
Based primarily on Linux/Gafgyt’s telnet scanning, KTN-RM improves on that spreading mechanism by carrying downloader executable binaries for embedded platforms such as routers and other connected devices. Targeting mainly those with weak login credentials.

„Further, the downloader‘s job is to request the Linux/Remaiten bot binary from the Command & Control server for its current architecture. When executed, it also creates another bot for the malicious operators to use. We have seen this technique used before by Linux/Moose to spread infections,“ says Michal Malík, ESET Malware Researcher.
