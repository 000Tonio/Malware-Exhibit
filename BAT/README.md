## Batch

A bunch of malicious software i built or Found while hunting.
For these...:
    Save the file in the startup folder for maximum impact
    Dont deploy on your main machine; Use VM or throwaway machine
    Some of these are detectable with AVs
    I didnt obfuscate the code since the malware is for educational purposes only
